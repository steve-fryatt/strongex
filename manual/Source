<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Strong Extract</cite> is a tool for extracting the files from StrongHelp manuals at the command line. It is written in C, and can be compiled to run on platforms other than RISC&nbsp;OS.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Command Line Usage" file="Use">

<cite>Strong Extract</cite> is a command line tool, and should placed in your library or on your path as appropriate. Once installed, it can be used in its most basic form as

<command>strongex &lt;source&nbsp;manual&gt; [-out] &lt;output&nbsp;folder&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]</command>

In this form, <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will compare the files contained in the source manual with the files in the output folder. Any changes are reported: files which would need to be added to the output folder, deleted from it, or which have been changed in the manual. If the specified output folder does not exist, then it will report all files from the manual as being added.

A file is considered to have changed if its filetype or contents have changed. Since some tools generate manuals with all their files dated 1 January 1900, dates are not compared.

As <cite>Strong Extract</cite> reads the manual file, simple integrity checks are carried out to verify that the contents make sense. This is not a foolproof guarantee that the manual is correctly formed, however.

If the <param>-update</param> parameter switch is included, <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will update the output folder (and create it first, if necessary) so that it matches the contents of the manual.

It is possible to add the <param>-verbose</param> parameter switch, in which case <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will generate more detailed information about what it is doing.

For more information about the options available, use <command>strongex -help</command>.

<subhead title="RISC&nbsp;OS and Linux">

<cite>Strong Extract</cite> can be built for use on both RISC&nbsp;OS and Linux, and the main difference between the two versions is in their handling of filenames and filetypes.

On RISC&nbsp;OS, the contents of the manual is extracted on to disc in the same form as they were stored in the manual. The main differences will stem from the fact that datestamps and file attributes are not preserved.

On Linux, filetypes are preserved by appending a standard <code>,xxx</code> suffix to the filename, where &quot;xxx&quot; is the filetype in hexadecimal. These suffixes are assumed to be present in any pre-existing output folder, and are used to obtain the filetypes of the files already there. In addition, any <code>/</code> characters in filenames are mapped to <code>.</code>. All other characters in names are retained, and care should be taken to ensure that they are valid on the target filing system.
