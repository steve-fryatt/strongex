<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Strong Extract</cite> is a command line tool for performing simple validation on StrongHelp manuals, and extracting the files from them. It is written in C, and can be compiled to run on platforms other than RISC&nbsp;OS.

It can provide details of the differences between the contents of a manual file and a corresponding collection of files on disc. There is also support for cross-platform handling of RISC&nbsp;OS filetypes.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Command Line Usage" file="Use">

<cite>Strong Extract</cite> is a command line tool, and should placed in your library or on your path as appropriate. Once installed, it can be used in its most basic form as

<command>strongex &lt;source&nbsp;manual&gt; [-out] &lt;output&nbsp;folder&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]</command>

If given only a source manual and an output folder, <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will compare the files contained in the source manual with the files in the output folder. Any changes which would be required to bring the output folder into step with the source manual are reported: files which would need to be added to the folder, deleted from it, or which are different in the manual. If the specified output folder does not exist, then <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will report that all of files from the manual will need to be added.

A file is considered to have changed if its filetype or contents are different. Since some tools generate manuals with all their files dated 1 January 1900, dates are not compared. Files with different names are treated as being completely different: there is no attempt to detect files which have been renamed but are otherwise unchanged.

As <cite>Strong Extract</cite> reads the manual file, simple integrity checks are carried out to verify that the contents make sense. This is not a foolproof guarantee that the manual is correctly formed, however. Any potential problems with the file structure are reported, including:

<list type="bullet">
<li>File entries which point to a <code>DIR$</code> block.
<li>Directory entries which point to a <code>DATA</code> block.
<li>Files and directories whose size does not match the block pointed to.
<li>Files with no block whose size is not zero.
<li>Blocks with unrecognized guard words.
</list>

If the <param>-verbose</param> parameter switch is used, <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will output more detailed information about the objects that it is reading.

By default, <cite>Strong Extract</cite> will simply compare the source manual and output folder contents, but if the <param>-update</param> parameter switch is used it will proceed to update the contents of the output folder from the source manual. The folder will be created if it does not already exist, and files will then be added, updated and removed until its contents match those of the source manual.

For more information about the options available, use <command>strongex -help</command>.

<subhead title="RISC&nbsp;OS and Linux">

<cite>Strong Extract</cite> can be built for use on both RISC&nbsp;OS and Linux, and the main difference between the two versions is in their handling of filenames and filetypes.

On RISC&nbsp;OS, the contents of the manual is extracted on to disc in the same form as it was stored in the manual. The main differences will stem from the fact that datestamps and file attributes are not preserved.

On Linux, filetypes are preserved by appending a standard <code>,xxx</code> suffix to the filename, where &quot;xxx&quot; is the filetype in hexadecimal. These suffixes are assumed to be present in any pre-existing output folder, and are used to obtain the filetypes of the files already there. Files whose names have no extension will be assumed to have a type of Data (&amp;FFD).

In addition, any <code>/</code> characters in the source manual filenames are mapped to <code>.</code> in the output folder. All other characters in names are retained, and care should be taken to ensure that they are valid on the target filing system.
